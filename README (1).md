## VPN Benefits
- Hides real IP address.  
- Encrypts internet traffic.  
- Protects privacy on public Wi-Fi.  
- Helps bypass geo-restrictions.  

## VPN Limitations
- Free VPNs have limited servers and speed caps.  
- Does not guarantee 100% anonymity.  
- May reduce browsing speed.  
- Some websites can still block VPN traffic.

## Key Concepts
- **VPN (Virtual Private Network):** Creates a secure, encrypted tunnel for internet traffic.  
- **Encryption:** Converts data into unreadable format to prevent snooping.  
- **Protocols:** OpenVPN, WireGuard, IKEv2/IPSec.  
- **VPN vs Proxy:** VPN encrypts all traffic, proxy only masks IP.
